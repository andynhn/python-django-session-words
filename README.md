# python-django-session-words
App where the user can add any new word to the session. The user can specify the color to display the word and whether the word should appear in bigger fonts. The words are displayed on the right and the user can clear session. Meant to demonstrate an understanding of session, radio buttons, and checkboxes (and how to update a list in session with append).
